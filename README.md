## About Me

My name is Małgorzata Jaglarz. I graduated from English Philology and European Studies at the Jagiellonian University. My professional experience includes teaching English and working for the Managing Institution of the Regional Operational Programme for the Małopolska Region.

I have had a long career break and recently decided to learn new skills to start my career in the IT industry. My goal is to become a software tester and I am committed to learning all new skills on my own to succeed in this role. I believe this might be a perfect job for me since I love to look things up. Moreover, I like the idea of working in an English-speaking environment, learning about new technologies and developing new skills.
